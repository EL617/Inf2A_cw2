Improvement:

We may have this kind of situations:

E.g:

	$$ John is a big cat.
		OK

	$$ Who is big?
		Eh??

	$$ Who is a cat?
		Eh??

	$$ Who is a big?
		John

This is because the given grammar only allows either 'is AR Ns' or 'is A' after 'P' in the sentence.
While in most of the sentences in our life using 'is AR A Ns' grammar.

It seems like 'John is a big cat' is parsed successfully, but it is parsed as 'John is a big' and ignored the last word 'cat'.
Then it should return an error in parsing the sentence.

In these cases, it is better to check the part of speech of each word in the statement language as well.
